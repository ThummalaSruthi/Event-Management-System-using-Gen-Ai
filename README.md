Event Management System using Generative AI 
The Event Management System, utilizing advanced generative AI technology, transforms the organization and implementation of events and competitions by automating essential processes seamlessly. This cutting-edge system employs sophisticated AI algorithms to intelligently gather and retain all event or contest details provided during registration. This research paper depicts how artificial intelligence is used in developing a â€œUser-Engaging Event Management System." The developed system will spontaneously record all the events and online contests registered. Motivates the user to participate in the particular event by providing sufficient resources, which enhances user performance in the event. It implements a persistent alarm or remainder system that operates continuously, ensuring participants never miss important deadlines. The system not only includes these functionalities but also presents a user-friendly interface that enables users to search for specific events, access in-depth details, and effortlessly enroll in their preferred events. Generative artificial intelligence in event management systems has the capability to create personalized gatherings based on the preferences and interests of attendees. This encompasses tailored content, recommendations for activities, and specifically crafted event schedules. In this system, users have the ability to search for and register for events.
